new game()  {game state inoitializes} 
--> draw func() 
    -->draw background -->draw background buildings -->draw main buildings -->draw gorilla 1 and 2-->draw bomb
--> aiming
--> throw bomb func()
--> animation func()
--> collision detection(either to another gorilla or building or bomb goes outside)
--> points updated as necessary
--> loop continues


Problem(1):
-->angle1DOM showing null value during aiming feature addition
Solution:
const angle1DOM = document.querySelector("#info-left .angle");
//changed to
const info1DOM = document.getElementById("info-left");
const angle1DOM=info1DOM.querySelector('.angle');

Problem(2):
-->after hitting enemy gorilla celebrating gorilla face was not showing
Solution:
async-await function implemented

Problem(3):
-->after the first hit , a player may take note of the present angle and speed and continue hitting his opponent
Solution:
change of windspeed after each hit: maintains relevance of points
